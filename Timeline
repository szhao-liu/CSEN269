interviewed with allan
got some ideas on initial steps
plan to ask freshman on campus about apps next

here are some of the feedbacks we got from the interview:

target audience: 9-12th high school students

based on feedback from allan:
- first beneficial -> university itself
- second beneficial -> school counselor
- third beneficial -> parents

allan's advice - go ask students who just experience this 

three verticals we could think about: 
- improving user experience (talk to young student for new user interface)
- chatbot based on website (allan can provides)
- motivate students to go to college? (implement a skill test during onboarding)
